# Project1 :ok_hand:

## Python project 1

### The app
- Get app working on pycharm by installing dependencies and interpreters
- Create a VM using vagrant with an environment which can run the app and the app installed
- Create an AMI using packer which is capable of running the app on it and can be used as a slave node on jenkins
- Make changes to the application and then commit the changes to github which triggers a jenkins CI build to test whether the altered app still passes the tests

### Cookbook
- Create recipe which provisions the environment sufficient to run the application
- Use this provisioned environment as a slave node on jenkins
